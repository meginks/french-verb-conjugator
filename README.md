# french-verb-conjugator 

Here i am attempting to do something similar to what I have started doing with the [Spanish Verb Conjugator](https://github.com/meginks/spanish-verb-conjugator)  but in Javascript. 
As with the Spanish Verb Conjugator project, I have created this to help myself understand French verbs better, but I have made it public in the event that thinking about it in this way is useful to anyone else who is learning French.

 Note that it is *very much* a work in progress. If you find an issue with it, please let me know. I obviously don't own the French language, and I did not come up with these rules of conjugation, but I did write all the code.
